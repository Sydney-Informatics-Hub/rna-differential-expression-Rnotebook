# RNAseq differential expression R notebook 

This R notebook demonstrates differential expression and functional enrichment analyses in a case control analysis. It was developed for the [2023 Introduction to RNAseq workshop](https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/rnaseq-workshop-2023/). See the [case study](https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/rnaseq-workshop-2023/notebooks/1.0_casestudy.html) explainer for more details. 

For materials accompanying this notebook, please see Day 2 the [training materials for our Introduction to RNAseq workshop](https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/rnaseq-workshop-2023/). A copy of the count matrix used in the workshop are also included in this repository in the `data/` directory. If you'd like to run it locally, you can execute it with our [RStudio for RNAseq container](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/Rstudio-rnaseq-contained) which has all required packages preinstalled. 

# Quickstart

To run this notebook in Gitpod, click the button below. It will take a few minutes to load in your browser. 

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/rna-differential-expression-Rnotebook)

This will open a remote [Gitpod workspace](https://gitpod.io/) with the notebook preloaded and all packages preinstalled. Gitpod is a free online IDE that allows you to run code in the cloud. The workspace will be available for free for 50 hours after you click the button. It will time out after 20 minutes of inactivity. 

Once your Gitpod workspace is set up, it will open a VScode window with the files in the repository in your browser. Navigate to the Setup RStudio
